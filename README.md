[![Build Status](https://platform-ci.scala-lang.org/api/badges/scalacenter/sbt-release-early/status.svg)](https://platform-ci.scala-lang.org/scalacenter/sbt-release-early)

`sbt-release-early` is an opinionated sbt plugin to follow the maxim *"Release early, release often"*. It
provides an automatic way to release artifacts on merge and via git tags, and automates all the
necessary steps to make releasing easy.

#### Goals:

1. Maintainers cut and handle releases in a breeze.
1. Users do not need to beg maintainers to release.
1. Open-source contributors have access to their changes as soon as their PRs are merged.
1. Maintainers can easily change the publisher they use (Bintray or Sonatype) and their CI setup.

## Installation and latest version

For installation, [here's a quick link](https://github.com/scalacenter/sbt-release-early/wiki/Essential:-Installation) to the pertinent wiki page.

## Read the docs

The docs are placed in a [detailed GitHub wiki](https://github.com/scalacenter/sbt-release-early/wiki).
They have been carefully written to contain all the information you may need to publish any package
in sbt. If something is missing, please contribute to them, the wiki is open to external editions.

They explain:

* The philosophy.
* How to install, use and configure the plugin.
* How to set up your CI, gpg and related infrastructure.
* How to release for different backends and CIs.
